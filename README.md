# postsmvi
## What I would improve
### Functionality
* I would have a recyclerview for the details screen, showing all of the comments. If the number of comments were huge I would consider pagination.

### Design
* Had the api supported it, I would have considered a Shared Element Transition of an ImageView from the List screen to the Details screen.

### Architecture
* I, unfortunately, used Domain models in the presentation layer. I would have done otherwise, but I was experimenting with MVI.
* I prefer MVVM, having used it on a previous project, but I wanted to try MVI.

### Dependency Injection
* I would like to try out Koin.

### Configuration
* I would consider trying out Gradle Kotlin DSL.

### Concurrency
* I would like to try out Coroutines.
